# pyStarMap

Python program to generate star charts. Originally forked from [https://github.com/potzie/starchart].

Program takes a latitude, longitude, and UTC timestamp and returns a .png star map of the sky at that date/time.

See `generate_charts.bat` for samples.

The program uses data from the Tycho2 catalogue: [http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/Cat?I/259] and 
the Revised New General Catalogue: [http://www.klima-luft.de/steinicke/ngcic/rev2000/Explan.htm].

There are quite a few options which are documented in the program:

`python chart.py --help`

To edit the colors of the image (background, line, text, etc), these can be found towards the top of chart.py.  Will be adding as an option soon.

The data that is included in the data folder (`eye_visible.dat`) only includes stars with magnitude of 6 or brighter. This was to reduce the total
file size. `eye_visible.dat` is only 467KB whereas the entire Tycho2 catalog is about 250MB and can't be stored on GitHub.  

However if you'd like to use the entire data file, can be generated by the following procedure:

1. Download the 20 data files from [http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/Cat?cat=I%2F259&target=http&] and concatenate them into 1 large (about 500MB) data file named tycho2.dat.
2. Download the suppl_1.dat file from [http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/Cat?cat=I%2F259&target=http&]
3. In the util folder, run the process_tycho.py file to generate the file needed for chart.py to run and place into the data folder.
